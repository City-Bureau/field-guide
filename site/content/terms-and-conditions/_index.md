## How does the Documenters.org pay scale work?

Our three most common assignments: 1) meeting notes + audio recording 2) live-tweeting + photos 3) special assignments.

All Documenters.org assignments are independent contracts based on a pay rate of $16 per hour, however some assignments also include a minimum base rate. Please note that City Bureau is not responsible for reimbursement of incidental expenses such as transit fare, highway tolls, parking, mileage, data use, food, etc.

### Public meeting-related assignments

* We pay $16 per hour.
* For meetings that run 2 hours or less, default pay is 3.5 hours: 2 hours for meeting attendance + 1.5 hours for pre-research, follow-up work, note editing, uploading, etc.
* If a meeting runs longer, we adjust your compensation to the meeting duration (rounded up to the nearest half hour) + 1.5 hours.
* If your assigned meeting is cancelled less than 72 hours in advance of the scheduled start time, we pay a “kill fee” of $16.

Please include the exact duration of your assigned meeting in your meeting checklist upon submission (meeting duration is confirmed through meeting minutes, official confirmation and Documenter checklists). All required content must be completed before an assignment is approved and payment is released. Submissions are due within 24 hours following the end of the meeting unless otherwise noted. City Bureau reserves the right to cancel payment for late or incomplete submissions.

### Special assignments

Unless otherwise noted in the assignment details, Street Team assignments and Special Assignments are paid at $16 per hour rounded up to the nearest half-hour. View your assigned meeting on Documenters.org for details and contact our Documenters Field Coordinator for questions.

## When will I get paid?

Soon after you receive your first assignment you’ll receive an email invitation from Gusto, the system we use to manage payments. Click the link in the email to create your account and enter your social security number, address, and bank account coordinates (The information is kept securely by Gusto). Once that information is entered you’ll be set up for direct deposit, and you’ll also be able to login anytime to see your payment records or tax forms. City Bureau’s operations team will also be in touch with further details around the payment process.

We run payments for all approved assignments weekly, and, provided you’ve set up your Gusto profile, the payment will be in your account 8-10 business days after we press the button. If you have any questions about payment contact your Documenters Field Coordinator.
