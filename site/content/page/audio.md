Missed that important quote or phone number? Consider using your phone as an audio recording device during board meetings and interviews. Having a clear audio recording can save time and ensure accuracy by providing a verbatim record.

## Requirements

* **Record in a Single Segment:** 
* **Timestamp Your Audio:** Write down key times displayed on your audio device as you record. By the end of your recording, you’ll have a written log that will allow you and our Documenters Manager to find important moments in your audio.

## Tips

1. **Find a quiet place:** Inaudible sounds to the human ear can still be picked up by your mobile device. Record in an empty room, hallway or other quiet location when possible.
2. **Get Close:** Position your recording device receiver within a few inches of your subject’s mouth or a speaker for the best audio.
3. **Watch the dial:**
4. **Ambiance:** Record snippets of “natural sound” along with interviews and audio from speakers. These natural sound elements can be used to edit and correct audio when producing stand-alone clips.

## Checklist

* Charge your device
* Silence your device before recording
* Test audio levels
* Position your recording device receiver close to your subject  
* Record in a quiet location’
* Record subjects spelling their full names and contact information
* Timestamp audio in your notes
