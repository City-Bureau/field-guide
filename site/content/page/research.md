If youâ€™ve selected your meeting or area of interest, be sure to study up before you attend.

## Web research

Start with an online search of keywords related to the department holding your meeting. Timely news articles about City Council can be searched with the words "Chicago City Council" AND the names of specific council members, i.e. Alderman James Smith OR a combination of topics related to your interest, i.e. "Alderman Joe Moore Chicago City Council participatory budgeting".

Seek out primary sources and trusted news outlets for the most up-to-date and accurate information.

## Documenters archive

Search [Documenters.org](https://beta.documenters.org/) for meeting notes and social media posts on a range of local departments.
