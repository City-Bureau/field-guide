**Answer: **

Review meeting documentation included with your assigned meeting, including meeting minutes, agenda, transcripts, previous Documenter content, etc (not all meetings will have documentation but most will). 

Clicking on “View original meeting details” or “View source” will take you to the website where we got the meeting time and date information. 

See the "Before You Begin" section of this Field Guide for more tips, tricks and resources on preparing for your assignment.
