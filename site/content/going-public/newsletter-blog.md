An old trope of good writing says to “write what you know.” The same can be said of local news and information. One way to help inform your community is to start a community newsletter If you have a question about your local alderman, your neighborhood school, your local city services or a national trend that relates to your community, there’s a good chance your neighbor could benefit from the same information. With your new media skills, you can take part in finding answers.

## Tips

* Find and read newsletters you like
  * Use publications that you enjoy reading to help shape a model for your own website, newsletter or blog. Seek out news that helps inform your worldview. Start by keeping and updating a list of news sources and checking them regularly.
* Decide on your medium
  * Online or print; Medium, Nuzzel or TinyLetter—there are many possible platforms for your blog or newsletter. Research on “blog platforms,” “newsletter services” and “content management systems” can help decide which works best for you.
* Know your audience
  * Provide ways for people to reach you. A survey is one way of finding out what your audience wants to know, but conversations with friends, family and neighbors are another great way to find out what information needs are present in your community.
* Share your work!
  * A little self-promotion can be a good thing. Let people know that you’re curating news and information they can use. Social media is just one place to start.
* Keep at it
  * Choose a regular schedule, i.e. daily, weekly, monthly, and try to stay consistent. Use social media to link readers to your work. With quality content, you’ll see your readership grow over time.
