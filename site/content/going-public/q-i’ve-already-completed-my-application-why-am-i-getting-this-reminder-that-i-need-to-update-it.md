**Answer:**

We’ve added a brief skills survey to help our staff better track growth, gaps and needs with the Documenters Program. If you filled out a Documenters application before October 2018, you'll need and fill out this short survey in order to complete your eligibility. The survey will be included in the Documenters Program application for all applicants after October 2018.

To update your application:

1. Log in to https://beta.documenters.org.
2. Click on your initials in the upper right hand corner.
3. Click on "Profile."
4. Click on "Edit application."
5. Click and drag the blue dots to indicate your skill in each of the six areas (photography, audio, video, notetaking, interviewing, social media).
6. Be sure to click "Submit" at the top of the page when you're done.
7. Once this is completed, you should see an option to apply for assignments when you click on them in the assignments tab.
