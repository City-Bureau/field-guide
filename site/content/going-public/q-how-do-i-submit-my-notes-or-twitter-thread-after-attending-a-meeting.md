**Answer: **

From your assignment approval message (Subject line: "Your next assignment awaits! Instructions and submission guidelines") click on the hyperlinked role next to your name (“Notetaking” or “Live-tweeting,” etc) to go directly to your submission form. You can also get there by going to “Profile” and clicking on “My assignments,” where you can view all assignments.

Click on the Google Doc thumbnail at the bottom of the submission form to copy/paste your notes. All notes should be submitted via the Google Doc attached to your assignment.
