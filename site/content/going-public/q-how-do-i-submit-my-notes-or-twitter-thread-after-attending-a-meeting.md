**Answer: **

When you receive the email that you’ve been assigned to a meeting, you can click on the hyperlinked role next to your name (“Notetaking” or “Live-tweeting”) to go directly to your submission form. You can also get there by going to “Profile” and clicking on “My assignments” and you can view all assignments in the assignments tab.

Click on the Google Doc thumbnail at the bottom of the screen to copy/paste your notes.
