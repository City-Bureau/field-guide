title: Working with your local newspaper
---
Does your local print or online news outlet take freelance pitches, run op-eds or accept letters to the editor? Reaching out to your area newspaper is a great way to reach a large audience while letting local editors know what issues they should be paying more attention to. The email addresses of editorial staff are typically posted on a news organizationâ€™s website. Try contacting the editor, managing editor or assignment editor to find the right avenue to plug in, whether that be pitching your own story idea, volunteering your time or submitting an opinion piece for publication.
