**Answer: **

You can view all open assignments on the right side of the assignments tab of Documenters.org. If you do not see this it is either because you are not logged in to your account or you have not yet updated your application. 

If you do not see your initials in the upper right corner of the screen, click on the blue “Log in” button to log into your account. If you are logged in, you may need to update your application.
