**Answer: **

This has to do with how mobile email apps deal with Internet links. If you are on a mobile device, try copying the link (hold down on the URL with your finger until you see the option to “copy”) then exit your mail app and pasting the link in your Internet browser app. 

Opening the link from a desktop or laptop computer should also fix this issue.
