## I’ve already completed my application. Why am I getting this reminder that I need to update it?



**Answer:**

We’ve added a brief skills survey to help our staff better track growth, gaps and needs with the Documenters Program. If you filled out a Documenters application before October 2018, you’ll need and fill out this short survey in order to complete your eligibility. The survey will be included in the Documenters Program application for all applicants after October 2018.

To update your application:

1. Log in to https://beta.documenters.org.
2. Click on your initials in the upper right hand corner.
3. Click on “Profile.”
4. Click on “Edit application.”
5. Click and drag the blue dots to indicate your skill in each of the six areas (photography, audio, video, notetaking, interviewing, social media).
6. Be sure to click “Submit” at the top of the page when you’re done.
7. Once this is completed, you should see an option to apply for assignments when you click on them in the assignments tab.





## When I click on an assignment, there isn’t any way to apply for it. How do I apply?

**Answer: **



You can view all open assignments on the right side of the assignments tab of Documenters.org. If you do not see this it is either because you are not logged in to your account or you have not yet updated your application.



If you do not see your initials in the upper right corner of the screen, click on the blue “Log in” button to log into your account. If you are logged in, you may need to update your application.





## WHEN I CLICK ON THE EMAIL LINK TO HTTPS://BETA.DOCUMENTERS.ORG ON MY PHONE, I GET A “BAD TOKEN” MESSAGE. HOW DO I GET AROUND THIS?

**Answer: **



This has to do with how mobile email apps deal with Internet links. If you are on a mobile device, try copying the link (hold down on the URL with your finger until you see the option to “copy”) then exit your mail app and pasting the link in your Internet browser app.



Opening the link from a desktop or laptop computer should also fix this issue.



## HOW CAN I PREPARE FOR MY ASSIGNMENT?

**Answer: **



Review meeting documentation included with your assigned meeting, including meeting minutes, agenda, transcripts, previous Documenter content, etc (not all meetings will have documentation but most will).



Clicking on “View original meeting details” or “View source” will take you to the website where we got the meeting time and date information.



## HOW DO I SUBMIT MY NOTES OR TWITTER THREAD AFTER ATTENDING A MEETING?

**Answer: **



From your assignment approval message (Subject line: “Your next assignment awaits! Instructions and submission guidelines”) click on the hyperlinked role next to your name (“Notetaking” or “Live-tweeting,” etc) to go directly to your submission form. You can also get there by going to “Profile” and clicking on “My assignments,” where you can view all assignments.



Click on the Google Doc thumbnail at the bottom of the submission form to copy/paste your notes. All notes should be submitted via the Google Doc attached to your assignment.



See the “Before You Begin” section of this Field Guide for more tips, tricks and resources on preparing for your assignment.
