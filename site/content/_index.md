title: Documenters Intro

Public meetings are important spaces for democracy, where any resident can participate in civic life and hold public figures accountable. But how does the public know when meetings are happening? It isn’t easy! These events are spread across dozens of websites, rarely in useful data formats.

That’s why City Bureau is working with a network of community organizations, governmental agencies, civic coders and engaged Chicagoans like you on the Documenters Program and City Scrapers Project, a Chicago-based open source community designed to standardize, scrape and share these meetings in a central database. 

Documenters are citizens and civic actors; creators and collaborators; representing a broad base of intergenerational, diverse communities. City Bureau recruits, trains and pays this group of highly engaged citizens to participate in the newsgathering process and contribute to a communal pool of knowledge.

Together we're democratizing news & information at the local level.
