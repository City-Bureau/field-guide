Public meetings are important spaces for democracy, where any resident can participate in civic life and hold public figures accountable. But how does the public know when meetings are happening? It isn’t easy! These events are spread across dozens of websites, rarely in useful data formats.

That’s why City Bureau is working with a network of community organizations, governmental agencies and civic coders to develop and coordinate the City Scrapers Project, a Chicago-based open source community designed to standardize, scrape and share these meetings in a central database. The City Scrapers Project is operated in collaboration with our Documenters Program, which pays and trains everyday denizens to document public governance meetings and report back to their community.
