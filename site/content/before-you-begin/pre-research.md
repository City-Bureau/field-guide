Once you're assigned to cover a meeting, be sure to study up before you attend. Many of these agencies are not well-known, so walking in prepared enables you to bridge that information gap. Plus, if an important issue will be discussed there, you want to know a bit about it in advance.

* Click on "View original meeting details" or "View website" on your assignment page to go to the agency website and learn more about what it does. Take a moment to write out a 1-3 sentence description of the agency in advance of the meeting, and you've already completed something that can turn into one of your tweets or notes entries.
* Confirm the meeting time and place. Committee meetings at City Hall are often shifted to a different room.
* Check for relevant previous Documenters content in the [Published view ](https://chicago.documenters.org/assignments/?alt=true)of the Assignments tab.
* Do an Internet search of keywords related to the department holding your meeting. Timely news articles about City Council can be searched with the words “\[Your City] City Council” AND the names of specific council members, i.e. Alderman James Smith OR a combination of topics related to your interest, i.e. “Alderman Joe Moore \[Your City] City Council participatory budgeting”. 
* Seek out primary sources and trusted news outlets for the most up-to-date and accurate information. Reliable web sources and articles can be posted during live-tweeting assignments and added to your meeting notes as hyperlinks.
