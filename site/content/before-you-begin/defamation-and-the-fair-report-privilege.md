## Defamation Law

**What is defamation?**

“Defamation” describes any statement that harms a person’s reputation to the the extent that it lowers the person in the eyes of the community. Defamation is not a crime, but it is a “tort” (a civil wrong, rather than a criminal wrong), meaning someone could sue you if they can prove you defamed them.

You’ll also hear this called “libel,” which is written defamation, and “slander,” which is spoken defamation.

**Why does it matter?**

A person who has been defamed can sue the person or publication that did the defaming for damages. If you put something defamatory in your notes you and City Bureau could be exposed to a lawsuit.

To establish a claim for defamation in Illinois, the accuser must show that the defendant published a statement about the plaintiff to a third party that was false, unprivileged, and damaged the plaintiff’s reputation.

**Let’s break that down.**

* Published to a third party: this definition is very broad, and includes just telling another person something in conversation.
* “About the plaintiff” must also apply to a specific individual or individuals and not a general group or category. Broad statements (ex. “all journalists are hacks” don’t qualify”)
* False: the statement must be provably false. Opinions, even mean ones, do not count as defamation because they can’t be proven false.
* Damaging: the plaintiff (the person suing) must show that they suffered a harm because the statement was published.
* Unprivileged: the statement can’t be exempted from defamation under a separate statute or court ruling. The Fair Report Privilege is one such privilege.

**A higher standard for public figures:**

If the person suing is a public official or public figure there is one more test: they must prove that the publisher knew that the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for whether it was true or false. (This is called “actual malice,” though the term is deceptive—it doesn’t have to do with malicious intent, but knowledge of falsehood.) 

## The Fair Report Privilege

The Fair Report Privilege shields reporters and publishers from liability for defamation where two requirements are met: 1) the report is of an official proceeding and 2) the report is complete and accurate or a fair abridgment of the official proceeding.

“Official proceedings” include court proceedings and government meetings. A “fair abridgment” means that the report must convey to readers a substantially correct amount, in other words, the report may not omit, add or charge anything in such a way as to to convey an erroneous or defamatory impression. This does not mean you must include everything that happened—“abridging” is fine. It does mean that your summary should not be selective—the abridgment must be accurate and “fair.”

Illinois courts have held that minor mistakes, especially those related to technical knowledge, do not invalidate the fair report privilege as long as the report is a substantially correct account of the proceeding. Nevertheless, it is important for Documenters’ notes to be as accurate as possible, so please flag anything you found confusing.

**Takeaways:**

* To prove defamation the accuser must show that the defendant published a statement about the plaintiff to a third party that was false, unprivileged, and damaged the plaintiff’s reputation. For public figures, the accuser must also show that the defendant knew the statement was false, or didn’t care if it was true or false.
* As long as you are covering an official proceeding and your report is substantially accurate, your published notes are covered under the Fair Report Privilege and should be protected from defamation claims.
* Be careful not to omit any important information in your notes in order to ensure that they meet the standards of the Fair Report Privilege.
