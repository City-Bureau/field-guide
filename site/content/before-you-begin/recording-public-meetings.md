## Overview:

A "meeting" is any gathering of a majority quorum of the members of a public body held for the purpose of discussing public business.

Your right to record public meetings is protected by under the Open Meetings Act but be sure to familiarize yourself with (and comply with) the relevant media policies for the public media you are assigned to. 

Be careful not to inadvertently record private conversations while covering public meetings.

When in doubt, comply when a governmental body insists you not record a meeting—but be sure to describe the reasons given and the circumstances in which the rule was provided in your notes and/or checklist.

## In Illinois:

The Illinois Open Meetings Act (“Act”) ensures that members of the public “may record the proceedings at meetings required to be open” under the Act, which include “all meetings of public bodies,” subject to certain exceptions. “Public bodies” include “all legislative, executive, administrative or advisory bodies” of the state, counties, towns, cities, and school districts. A “meeting” for purposes of the Act is “any gathering . . . of a majority of a quorum of the members of a public body held for the purpose of discussing public business.”Meetings of public bodies may be closed, however, where the public body considers a number of subjects, such as employment issues, collective negotiating matters, and security procedures, among others. 

Witnesses may not be compelled to testify at certain public meetings if they will be broadcast, televised, or filmed. Thus, to the extent witnesses object to having their testimony recorded, the authority holding the meeting must prohibit such recording.  The public entity holding the meeting must “prescribe reasonable rules” regarding the recording of public meetings. Id. Documenters should therefore make sure to familiarize themselves with (and comply with) the relevant media policies for the public meetings they cover.

Documenters should be careful not to inadvertently record private conversations while covering public meetings. Illinois law makes it a criminal offense to knowingly and intentionally record private conversations, in a surreptitious manner, without the consent of all the parties to the conversation. 

## In Michigan:

Like Illinois, Michigan’s Open Meetings Act also protects the public’s right to record public meetings; attendees may tape-record, videotape, broadcast live on radio, and telecast live on television the proceedings of a public body at a public meeting. However, a public body may establish reasonable rules and regulations in order to minimize the possibility of disrupting the meeting. Id.

Michigan is also an all-party consent state, meaning that it is a criminal offense to eavesdrop on private conversations without the consent of all parties. Documenters must therefore be careful not to record private conversations when covering public meetings.

## In North Carolina:

Like Illinois and Michigan, North Carolina also has a law that establishes the public’s right to photograph, film, tape-record, or “otherwise reproduce” any part of a meeting that is required to be open to the public. A public body in North Carolina may also regulate the placement and use of equipment so as to prevent undue interference with the meeting.

Unlike Illinois and Michigan, North Carolina is a one-party consent state. North Carolina law prohibits someone from “willfully” recording a private conversation without the consent of at least one party to the conversation.  Documenters should therefore be conscious that they do not record private conversations.
