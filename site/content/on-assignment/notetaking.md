title: Notetaking

Good notetaking is the most essential skill for good documentation. We’ve listed some best practices below but the truth is, the best notes are the notes that help you record accurate information. Use your raw notes (taken during or shortly thereafter the meeting) to create a more readable, thorough document that you may share on your blog, social media account or for an article or assignment. The best documentation will give your readers a sense of place. Note the mood in the room, interesting gestures, long silences. These details will add color to your writing—but they begin with sharp observation skills and taking good notes.

## On assignment

Your meeting notes should be between 2 pages or less and include at least 10 hyperlinks and 5 keyword tags when submitted for approval.

### Tips

* Simplify
  * Stick to keywords, phrases and short sentences to maximize the number of points you record (you can always add later). Write notes in your own words while including verbatim quotes when possible. Make sure you have a clear system for distinguishing between the two.
* What works best
  * Doodles, illustrations, bullet lists, abbreviations, scribbles and lines are all fair game. Develop a notetaking method that works for you.
* Listen and learn
  * Make a conscious effort to pay attention. Concentrate on being accurate and hearing different perspectives. Concentrate on concentrating.
* Make connections
  * Notetaking by hand? Weave blank space throughout your notes to backfill with comments, questions and connections that arise throughout meeting. Typing? Use functions like **bold** and <span style="text-decoration:underline">underlined</span> text to group similar sections.
* Review and edit
  * Following the meeting, make sure your writing is legible, any scribbles are clarified and all your “i”s are dotted following the meeting. But don’t wait too long between writing and review. Useful details may fade from your memory over time.
