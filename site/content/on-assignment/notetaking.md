> Good notetaking is the most essential skill for good documentation. We’ve listed some best practices below but the truth is, the best notes are the notes that help you record accurate information. Use your raw notes (taken during or shortly thereafter the meeting) to create a more readable, thorough document that you can share on your blog, social media account or for an article or assignment. Good notes will give your readers a sense of place. Describe the mood in the room, interesting gestures, long silences. These details will add color to your writing—but they begin with sharp observation skills.

## ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS

* Your meeting notes should be 1-3 pages in length, single spaced, and submitted via the Google Doc attached to your assignment. The correct Google Doc is shared to your email address each time you are assigned to document a meeting. See **SAMPLE MEETING NOTES TEMPLATE and EXAMPLE MEETING NOTES** below for what to expect.
* Include at least 10 hyperlinks throughout the text of your notes (a hyperlink is a link in your text that connects readers with an external website (ex. this is a hyperlink)

## TIPS

1. **Read the documentation:** Prepare for your assignment by reading any meeting minutes, agendas, transcripts and other documentation associated with your meeting.
2. **Create a system:** It’s ok to stick to keywords, phrases and short sentences to maximize the number of points you record during you assigned meeting (you can always add later). Raw notes can be used to create a more thorough submission.
3. **Listen and learn:** Make a conscious effort to pay attention during your assignment. Concentrate on being accurate and hearing different perspectives. 
4. **Make connections:** Notetaking by hand? Weave blank space throughout your notes to backfill with comments, questions and connections that arise throughout meeting. Typing? Use functions like bold and underlined text to group similar sections.
5. **Review and edit:** Following the meeting, make sure your writing is legible, any scribbles are clarified and all your “i”s are dotted following the meeting. But don’t wait too long between writing and review. Useful details may fade from your memory over time.
