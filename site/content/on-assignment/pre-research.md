If you’ve selected your meeting or area of interest, be sure to study up before you attend.

Start with an online search of keywords related to the department holding your meeting. Timely news articles about City Council can be searched with the words “Chicago City Council” AND the names of specific council members, i.e. Alderman James Smith OR a combination of topics related to your interest, i.e. “Alderman Joe Moore Chicago City Council participatory budgeting”. 

Seek out primary sources and trusted news outlets for the most up-to-date and accurate information. Reliable web sources and articles can be posted during live-tweeting assignments and added to your meeting notes as hyperlinks.
