## TIPS

1. **Get the details:** List names of presenters at the meeting (include titles, affiliations and twitter handles, if applicable, and any stated goals of the meeting. When possible include solutions and next steps presented.
2. **Post visuals:** Add multimedia (Twitter allows for photos, videos and GIFs) and links to relevant external content, such as timely news articles and official website links.
3. **Know the quotes:** Tweet the main concerns of attendees and why those concerns were raised by tweeting or paraphrasing relevant comments or concerns from officials and attendees.
4. **Join the conversation:** Retweeting can be as useful as tweeting. Watch and quote tweet conversations related to your meeting or the issue at hand via hashtags, i.e. words or unspaced phrases with a number sign or pound sign (#) placed before it (ex: #Documenters #FieldGuide).
5. **Describe the scene:** Describe features of the room and/or the overall environment (i.e. Was the crowd eager or angry? Did the presenters seem prepared?)

## THREADING YOUR TWEETS

Threading keeps your tweets together and in order so that others can easily access and make sense of your live-tweet coverage. Practice threading in advance to make sure you'll be able to do it correctly during a meeting.

1. Navigate to the Twitter home screen by selecting the house icon on the bottom left side of your screen. 
2. Select the "new tweet" button on the bottom right side of the screen (This button looks like a feather with a plus sign on the bottom right side of your screen)
3. Write and post your first tweet.
4. Select your first tweet.
5. Tweet your second tweet as a reply to the first, using the speech bubble or the blue "Add Another Tweet" button. Avoid the grey "Add Another Tweet" button as it replies to the selected tweet and may break or loop your thread.
6. Reply to **each subsequent tweet** to continue the thread.

## ALTERNATIVE METHOD: PRE-THREAD TWEETS

We prefer in-the-moment tweets but if you're unable to tweet at the meeting or are still getting the hang of Twitter and threading use this method:

1. Type a tweet--but don't post yet.
2. Tap the blue circle with a plus sign on the lower right side of the text window.
3. This will organize drafts of your tweets in one thread.
4. You can tap on any tweet in the thread to edit it.
5. If you want to view something else on Twitter, hit "save draft" before you exit the edit window.
6. Your thread won’t go live until you hit “Tweet all."
