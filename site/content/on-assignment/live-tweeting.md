Social media is a great way to have your voice heard, inform your community and connect with engaged global citizens. Twitter is a good place to start in addition to platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. 

Note: All Documenters live-tweeting assignments must be tweeted in a single "thread"—see further instructions on threading below.

## Requirements

* Post at least 10-15 tweets **in a single Twitter "thread" **(see our how-to on threading your tweets below).
* Your first tweet must include the following text:
  * Hi, I’ll be live-tweeting (name/title of event) for @ChiDocumenters #ChiDocumenters
* Conclude your Twitter thread with a sign off (ex. This concludes the Chicago Board of Education meeting. The next meetings is scheduled for March 23, 2019)

## On assignment?

1. Try to include the following in your live-tweet thread:

* Reason for the meeting (why are people here?)
* Start time (i.e. Did the meeting start on time?)
* Number of people at the event (not including city officials)
* List names of presenters at the meeting (include titles, affiliations and twitter handles, if applicable)
* Tweet any stated goals of the meeting and any actions taken (i.e. motions passed)
* Tweet the main concerns of attendees and why those concerns were raised
* Tweet any next steps and solutions
* Describe features of the room and/or the overall environment (i.e. Was the crowd eager or angry? Did the presenters seem prepared?)
* Add any relevant hashtags for the event. (ex. #ChicagoPublicSchools, #WaterQuality #2019chibudget)

1. End your thread by signing off—include the @ChiDocumenters hashtag in your final tweet. When possible let your followers know when the next meeting is.

## Tips for Twitter

1. **Always “thread” your posts:** Threads will help readers follow your meeting (see page XX for diagram instructions).
2. **Visuals:** Add multimedia (Twitter allows for photos, videos and GIFs) and links to relevant external content
3. **Know the quotes:** Select and tweet relevant quotes from officials and attendees.
4. **Join the conversation:** Retweeting can be as useful as tweeting. Watch conversations related to your meeting or the issue at hand via hashtags, i.e. words or unspaced phrases with a number sign or pound sign (#) placed before it (ex: #Documenters #FieldGuide).
5. **Take notes:** Bring a notepad to record names of officials, attendees, timestamps and other useful information. This information can help inform your social media posts. Not every quote will be tweetable but if you’re taking notes you’ll be able to go back and find the best quotes/info to tweet.
