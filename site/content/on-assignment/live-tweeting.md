## TIPS

1. **Get the basics:** Include information like the meeting start time, the number of people at the event (not including city officials) and the reasons why the meeting is being held.
2. **Get the details:** List names of presenters at the meeting (include titles, affiliations and twitter handles, if applicable, and any stated goals of the meeting. When possible include solutions and next steps presented.
3. **Post visuals:** Add multimedia (Twitter allows for photos, videos and GIFs) and links to relevant external content.
4. **Know the quotes:** Tweet the main concerns of attendees and why those concerns were raised by tweeting or paraphrasing relevant comments or concerns from officials and attendees.
5. **Join the conversation:** Retweeting can be as useful as tweeting. Watch and quote tweet conversations related to your meeting or the issue at hand via hashtags, i.e. words or unspaced phrases with a number sign or pound sign (#) placed before it (ex: #Documenters #FieldGuide).
6. **Describe the scene:** Describe features of the room and/or the overall environment (i.e. Was the crowd eager or angry? Did the presenters seem prepared?)
