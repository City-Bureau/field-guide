Missed that important quote or phone number? Having a clear audio recording can save time and ensure accuracy by providing a verbatim record. We use audio recordings to share that verbatim record with the public and draft contextualized reports, drawing connections between meetings, board members and public speakers.



## ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS

* **Record in a Single Segment:** Record you assigned meeting in one single file or as few clips as possible. 
* **Timestamp:** Write down key times displayed on your audio device as you record. By the end of your recording, you’ll have a written log that will allow you and our Documenters Manager to quickly find important moments in your audio.



## TIPS

1. **Get Close:** Position your recording device receiver within a few inches of your subject’s mouth or a speaker/amplifier for the best audio.
2. **Find a stable surface:** When possible, don’t hold your recording device in your hand—look for a stable surface on the same level as your audio subject.
3. **Check your levels:** If your recording device features a display be sure to watch the dial. For wave height, taller waves mean louder sound; for wave color, red means your audio is too loud. The ideal display settings will show a moderate wave height with green bars.
4. **Remember:** you have the right to record any public meeting that qualifies under the Open Meetings Act.
