Missed that important quote or phone number? Consider using your phone as an audio recording device during board meetings and interviews. Having a clear audio recording can save time and ensure accuracy by providing a verbatim record.

## Tips

* Find a quiet place
  * Inaudible sounds to the human ear can still be picked up by your mobile device. Record in an empty room, hallway or other quiet location when possible.
* Get Close
  * Position your recording device receiver within a few inches of your subject’s mouth for the best audio.
* Timestamp
  * Write down key times displayed on your audio device as you record. By the end of your recording, you’ll have a written log that will allow you to find important moments.
* Record in Sections
  * Recording in segments will make your audio easier to send, save and sort.  
* Ambiance
  * Record snippets of “natural sound” along with interviews and audio from speakers. These natural sound elements can be used to edit and correct audio when producing stand-alone clips.
