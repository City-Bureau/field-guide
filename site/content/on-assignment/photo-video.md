## ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS

* Check in with a Documenters Manager for requirements on this role.

## TIPS

1. **Find a steady support:** Make use of a tripod, tree stump, banister, shelf or nearby railing for stability.
2. **Find the light:** Head toward the nearest light source for the clearest image. When outdoors, keep the sun at your back to avoid backlighting your subject.
3. **Frame it:** Vary your perspective but always shoot horizontally. Take wide shots by stepping back and close-ups by filling the frame. Use the rule of thirds as a guide by placing points of interest along the four main intersections (see the Rule of Thirds diagram below).
4. **Change your focus:** Tap your mobile screen to change the focus of your shot and its exposure.
5. **Avoid zoom:** Zooming often leads to pixelation. Instead, move closer to your subject when possible.
