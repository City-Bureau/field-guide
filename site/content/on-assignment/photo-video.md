When it comes to documentation, text is better with images. Be sure to take video and/or photos of your meeting to add context and color to your notes, social media or newsletter.

## Tips

* Find a steady support
  * Make use of a tripod, tree stump, banister, shelf or nearby railing for stability.
* Find the light
  * Head toward the nearest light source for the clearest image. When outdoors, keep the sun at your back to avoid backlighting your subject.
* Frame it
  * Vary your perspective but always shoot horizontally. Take wide shots by stepping back and close-ups by filling the frame. Use the rule of thirds as a guide by placing points of interest along the four main intersections (see page XX):
* Change your focus
  * Tap your mobile screen to change the focus of your shot and its exposure.
* Avoid zoom
  * Zooming often leads to pixelation. Move closer to your subject instead.
