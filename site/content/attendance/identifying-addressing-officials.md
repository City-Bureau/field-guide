## Addressing officials
There are no laws governing how citizens address public officials at public governance meetings. When in doubt, use good judgment.

* Alderman/Alderwoman/Alderperson
* Chair
* Clerk
* Councilman/Councilwoman/Council Member
* Mayor
* Mr.
* Mrs.
* Ms.
* President
* Secretary

## Identifying yourself

I am a resident of the state of Illinois working in the public interest to document civic events and meetings subject to the Open Meetings Act. My documentation is made publicly available in collaboration with City Bureau, a Chicago-based civic journalism lab.
